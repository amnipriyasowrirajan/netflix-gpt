- Regex => for email validation

- You can either use a state variable to store the email and password information, or you can use useRef.
- using useRef is created by react

- When you submit the sign-in form, it will refresh the page. So, in the form, add onSubmit={(e) => e.preventDefault()} => i dont want to submit the form.
- useRef is used for reference a field or tag over email & password
- install redux library => i am going install two libraries
  - npm i D @reduxjs/toolkit
  - npm i react-redux
- create a new file an utils=> appStore =>import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
- create a new file another file in utils=> userSlice.js => import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
